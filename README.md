# Zomato_Restaurant_Analysis_Excel_Dashboard

### Overview:
Zomato, a global restaurant aggregation and meal delivery service, faced the challenge of harnessing its vast data to make data-driven decisions and enhance the dining experience for its users. In response, we embarked on the "Interactive Zomato Data Analysis in Power BI" project, aimed at providing comprehensive insights into the restaurant industry.

### Key Objectives:
  + **Global Restaurant Insights**:
Our analysis revealed that the Asian continent boasts the highest number of restaurants, totaling an impressive 8,849 establishments. Further exploration pinpointed India as the global leader, contributing 8,652 restaurants to this remarkable count.

 + **Average Cost Assessment**:
In our quest for valuable insights, we identified that the Asian continent also carries the distinction of the highest average cost, with an average expenditure of $1,288.47 per meal.

 + **Ratings Analysis**:
While Asia leads in restaurant numbers, its average rating of 2.5 places it at the lower end of the scale. In contrast, the African continent claims the title for the highest average ratings, standing at an impressive 4.21. Within Africa, South Africa shines with an equivalent rating, leading the pack.

 + **Cuisine Count Insights**:
Delving into cuisine diversity, Asia takes the top spot again, offering an astounding 112 different cuisines. Zooming in on individual countries, India emerges as the leader with a rich assortment of 90 cuisines. However, the same exploration reveals that the South American continent, abbreviated as "SAM," lags in the global cuisine count.

### Conclusion :
This Project is helpful in analyzing the sales market of Zomato. From this Project I would like to conclude that as Zomato is an Indian Company that's why is market is broader in India than in other countries as it is linked with only 15 countries and out of that 15 countries, It has greatly expanded its routes in India therefore all the top items from different categories are from India only. In India it has main markets in Bangalore, Mumbai and Delhi. Currently the services of Zomato is also limited which creates a breaker in its expansion. If the company will focus upon their advance services then they may be able to expand their branch and market worldwide. The main motive of this project is to gain knowledge about Zomato Company and its worldwide connections and to learn new features of excel.
